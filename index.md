# **Lab Report 4**

## **Step 4**

Keys pressed: `<enter>, <enter>`

The `ssh` command allows me to connect to a remote device from my local device using an insecure network. The `<enter>` keys were used to input the username and password.

## **Step 5**

Keys pressed: `<rightmb><enter>`

The `git clone` command allows me to clone my fork of the repository from my Github account. The `<rightmb>` was used to paste the github link.

## **Step 6**

Keys pressed: `<rightmb><enter>, <rightmb><enter>`

I used the `cd` command to change directories into the lab7 directory in order to be able to run the tests. I was using the `<rightmb>` to paste in the command to compile and run the testers, I copied these commands from the week 3 course website.

## **Step 7**

Keys pressed: `<down>x43 <right>x12 <backspace> <2> <ctrl+o> <enter> <ctrl+x> <y>`

The nano command allows me to open the file and edit it. I had to use the `<down>` key 43 times because the line that needed to be changed was on line 43, same with the `<right>` key being used 12 times. The error was that index1 needed to be changed to index2. The shortcut `ctrl+o` allows me to save the file and `ctrl+x` exits the file and saves the changes.

## **Step 8**

Keys pressed: `<up><up><up><enter>, <up><up><up><enter>`

I reran the tester after making the necessary changes, i used the `<up>` key 3 times because the `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` command was 3 up in the history. Then I used the `<up>` key 3 times again because the `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` command was 3 up in the history.
